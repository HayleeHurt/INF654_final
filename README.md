# INF654_final
This is my final project for INF 654 mobile web development. It is a basic web application that should help to manage orders for a small business. It currently has a side navigation and main horizontal nav as well. I will continue to work on it and get it functional in the coming weeks. It is very simsilar to the project we are working on in class. Ideally the way this appplication would work in the future would be to manage all orders from a database on the web app. In theory it would have the ability to pull all the upcoming orders from the database, display them and then allow for the user to keep or dismiss the order. If they dismissed the order then it would be sent back to the database in a new column or table showing that is was completed. The the user would be able to see all the completed orders, all the current orders, and all the upcoming orders on the web app. They would also be able to tweak or edit the orders through the app as well, so if a client told them about a new addition or change to the application they could empliment it into the manager the database would be updated as well.
